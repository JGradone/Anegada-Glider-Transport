# Anegada-Glider-Transport

This repository contains the code used in the analysis performed in Gradone et al. (2023): Upper Ocean Transport in the Anegada Passage from Multi-Year Glider Surveys

The dataset used in this analysis can be found here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7468695. This dataset contains glider-acoustic doppler profiler observations from four glider deployments in the Anegada Passage region from 2020-2022. The 2020-2021 data are from a Nortek AD2CP and the 2022 data are from a Teledyne RDI Pathfinder. The RDI Pathfinder .PD0 files can be read directly in this code.  The Nortek AD2CP .ad2cp files are processed using Nortek's MIDAS software to generate NetCDFs.
